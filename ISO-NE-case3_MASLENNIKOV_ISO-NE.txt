Case: ISO-NE_case3

-------Description----------
Power system: ISO New England is a North-East part of the Eastern Interconnection in the USA
Peak load is about 26,000 MW

Date of event: July 20, 2017

Type of oscillations: regional mode observed in multiple places

Frequency: 1.13Hz

Peak-to-peak magnitude: up to 115 MW

Is it a resonance condition case?: No

Location of the source: Area 1, see map ISO-NE_map.pdf. 
The source is located East from Sub:2 connected by Ln:2 and Ln:4.

Details of the source: large generator in Area 1

Confidence level on the known location of the source: 100%

Duration of time interval of submitted PMU data: 3 min

Comments: 
Some equipment issues in a large generator has created 1.13Hz oscillations with growing magnitude 
during 40 seconds. Oscillations with significat MW magnitude were observed in 
multiple locations of the New England power system.
